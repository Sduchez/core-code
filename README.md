***WEEK ONE***

Watch this video about compilation and interpretation- DONE
Search and answer the question: Java language is compiled or interpreted? ** JAva is both a compiled and interpreted language.
Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD
    
    int localCurrency = 0;
    int roe = 0;
    int convertion =  localCurrency * roe;
    String foreingCurrencyName;
    String localCurencyName;
    
    System.out.println("What is the name of the local currency to be converted");
    localCurrencyName = Read.nextLine();
    System.out.println("What is the amount of local currency to be converted");
    localCurrency = Read.nextLine();
    System.out.println("What is the the rate of exchange");
    roe = Read.nextLine();
    System.out.println("What is the name of the foreign currecy");
    foreignCurrencyName = Read.nextLine();
    System.out.println(localCurrencyName + " converted to " + foreignCurrencyName + " equals " + convertion);
    
Read about Pseudocode here, you can also find some examples here
Anwser to the question: Why is pseudocode helpful? **I believe is useful as it grants flexibility, you donÂ´t have to worry about syntax, is the fast way to solve the problem without thinking of the technical aspects of your code** 

Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like for example i could define Y <-- 2022)

    thisYear = 2022
    yob = 0
    userYob = 0
    functionYourAge = thisYear - yob;

Read about flowcharts here
Answer to the question: Why are flowcharts important to us as developers? **I think flowcharts will give us as developers the chance to graphicly see the process that we are about to build, is a tangible way to determine the path for coding**
Search about High-level languages and Low-level languages, you can start with this video


**WEDNESDAY**
Learn about binary, decimal and hexadecimal numbers
Translate the year you where born to binary, decimal and hexadecimal
    My YOB 1983
    Binary: 11110111111
    Decimal:1983
    Hex: 7BF
Translate 51966 into hexadecimal and binary: LOL   CAFE
Use a Low-level language, for example MIPS aseembler, to do so, you will need to follow this guide. We recomend to check the guide first but also this presentation could be helpful.

Base on the examples and the guide of the low-level language: 5.1 Create a program to add two numbers given by the user 5.2 Create a program that display your name


**THURSDAY**

    Search for real word applications of Javascript:
    
        class Calculator {
      add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
      }

      sub(a, b) {
        return a - b;
      }

      mul(a, b) {
        return a * b;
      }

      div(a, b) {
        if (b == 0) throw new Error('div by 0 not allowed');
        return a / b;
      }
    }

    const a = 12;
    const b = 6;

    const cal = new Calculator();

    const AplusB = cal.add(a,b);
    const AminusB = cal.sub(a, b);
    const AtimesB = cal.mul(a, b);
    const AdivB = cal.div(a, b);

    const results = [AplusB, AminusB, AtimesB, AdivB];

    console.log(results);
