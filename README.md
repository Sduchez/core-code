Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD
    
    int localCurrency = 0;
    int roe = 0;
    int convertion =  localCurrency * roe;
    String foreingCurrencyName;
    String localCurencyName;
    
    System.out.println("What is the name of the local currency to be converted");
    localCurrencyName = Read.nextLine();
    System.out.println("What is the amount of local currency to be converted");
    localCurrency = Read.nextLine();
    System.out.println("What is the the rate of exchange");
    roe = Read.nextLine();
    System.out.println("What is the name of the foreign currecy");
    foreignCurrencyName = Read.nextLine();
    System.out.println(localCurrencyName + " converted to " + foreignCurrencyName + " equals " + convertion);
    
Read about Pseudocode here, you can also find some examples here
Anwser to the question: Why is pseudocode helpful? **I believe is useful as it grants flexibility, you donÂ´t have to worry about syntax, is the fast way to solve the problem without thinking of the technical aspects of your code** 

Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like for example i could define Y <-- 2022)

thisYear = 2022
yob = 0
userYob = 0
yourAge = thisYear - yob;

Answer to the question: Why are flowcharts important to us as developers? **I think flowcharts will give us as developers the chance to graphicly see the process that we are about to build, is a tangible way to determine the path for coding**
